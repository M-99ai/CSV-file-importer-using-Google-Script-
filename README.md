# CSV-file-importer-using-Google-Script-
I have developed an CSV file importer using HTML and JavaScript. HTML is used for creating an impressive User-Interface and JavaScript for main Objective. This web app can convert even large CSV files and display it into Excel form. This can be done just by uploading the CSV file. This makes the application user friendly.
